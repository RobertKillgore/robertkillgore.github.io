<p>The bluebloods of college basketball were not their usual selves in the 2020-2021 season, Kentucky being the most disappointing of them all. The Wildcats went 9-16 this year and finished 8-9 in conference play, missing the NCAA tournament for the first time since 2013. To begin looking at what went wrong for Kentucky this season, let’s start by grabbing the games logs for each team of the 2020-2021 season.</p>

<p>To get started, I’m going to look at cumulative point differential for the teams in the SEC. You would think a team with a positive point differential should be at least .500 while a team with a negative point differential should be below .500.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>sec &lt;- logs21 %&gt;% 
  mutate(pointdifferential = TeamScore - OpponentScore) %&gt;% group_by(Team) %&gt;% mutate(CumPointDiff = cumsum(pointdifferential)) %&gt;% filter(Conference == &quot;SEC&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Now that we got the cumulative point differential for each team in the SEC, let’s compare Kentucky to the 22-6 Arkansas Razorbacks and the 13-14 Auburn Tigers.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>uk &lt;- sec %&gt;% filter(Team == &quot;Kentucky&quot;)

Kentucky ended up finishing the year with a positive point differential, something not typically seen in a 9-16 team. One reason for this is the Wildcats were 2-8 in games decided by 4 points or less, including a one point loss against Mississippi State in the SEC tournament. Say they go 5-5 instead, Kentucky ends up 12-13, a slightly below-average team.</p>
<p>Now, let’s look at Kentucky’s total turnovers and steals compared to the rest of the SEC. If a team forces a lot of turnovers in a given game, they steal away their opponents precious possessions and increase the likelihood of winning that game. Let’s see how well Kentucky kept care of the ball and how well they wrecked havoc on the defensive end.</p>

<p>I want to create a graph which highlights teams total turnovers and steals. I will use a dumbbell chart to show this, which shows the difference between two things on a number line. I’m going to make turnovers blue and steals purple. The total amount of turnovers and steals for each team will be on the x-axis and the y-axis will have the SEC teams, reordered by the amount of turnovers.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot() +

Kentucky ended up the year with less turnovers than top teams like Alabama and Arkansas, but had far less steals than them. Teams that made the tournament like LSU, Tennessee, and Alabama lines from steals and turnovers were smaller than Kentucky’s, showing how important turnover differential is to winning.</p>
<p>Now, let’s jump to field goal percentage and compare Kentucky’s field goal shooting percentage to the rest of the power five teams. In the John Calipari era, Kentucky has had elite shooters like Devin Booker, Tyler Herro, and Malik Monk. Freshman guard Brandon Boston Jr was supposed to be that guy, but finished the season shooting 30% from three and shooting 35.5% from the field.</p>

<p>I only care about the power five teams, so let’s get rid of the non-power five teams</p>

<pre class="r"><code>powerfive &lt;- logs21 %&gt;% filter(Conference %in% powerfive)</code></pre>
<p>Next, I need to find out the field goal percent average for the power five throughout the season and Kentucky’s. Then using that information, we can compare Kentucky’s field goal percentage throughout the season to the power five.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>fieldgoalaverage &lt;- logs21 %&gt;% group_by(Date) %&gt;% summarise(mean_fieldgoalshooting=mean(TeamFGPCT))</code></pre>

<p>Besides the spike in early January, Kentucky was constantly below the power five average most of the season. Not exactly a winning formula.</p>
<p>Now, let’s see where Kentucky ranked in the SEC in total offensive rebounds and compare them with th power five. More offensive rebounds should lead to teams with more chances to score</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(tidyverse)
library(ggbeeswarm)
library(ggrepel)</code></pre>

<pre><code>## `summarise()` has grouped output by &#39;Team&#39;. You can override using the `.groups` argument.</code></pre>
<p>Next, we have to filter out for Kentucky. Then we create a beeswarm plot comparing power five teams in offensive rebounds</p>
<pre class="r"><code>uk &lt;- offensiverebounds %&gt;% filter(Team== &quot;Kentucky&quot;)</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot() + geom_beeswarm(data=offensiverebounds, groupOnX=TRUE, aes(x=Conference, y=totaloffensiverebounds), color=&quot;grey&quot;) +  geom_point(data=uk, aes(x=Conference, y=totaloffensiverebounds), color=&quot;blue&quot;)  +
